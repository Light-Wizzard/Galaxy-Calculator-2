 We\+Book\+Client is a Client/\+Server based Web-\/\+Book Content Management System

This is We\+Book\+Client, it is meant to work with We\+Book\+Server. The documentation is spread out between \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBook}{\texttt{ We\+Book}} and \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBookServer}{\texttt{ We\+Book\+Server}}.

You can find more information at the Wiki\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBook/wiki}{\texttt{ We\+Book Wiki}}, \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBookClient/wiki}{\texttt{ We\+Book\+Client Wiki}}, \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBookServer/wiki}{\texttt{ We\+Book\+Server Wiki}}.

I used the Qt Rich Text Editor Project and documentation.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{Table of Content}\label{index_autotoc_md15}

Linux\+: \href{https://travis-ci.org/Light-Wizzard/WeBookClient}{\texttt{ }}

I am posting this only so I can get the Travis and App\+Veyor Builds to work.

Currently it works somewhat, and missing a lot of features, it currently does not talk with the We\+Book\+Server.

It will run on Windows 10, but building the Deploy file failed.

M\+S\+VC has an Error in the Make\+File line 141, its a Private Class.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{Downloads}\label{index_autotoc_md17}

The We\+Book Concept is to have a Client known as We\+Book\+Client, commumicate and control the Server known as We\+Book\+Server, in a multi-\/user collabration, designed for managing Web-\/\+Books.

A Web-\/\+Book also known as a We\+Book, is an H\+T\+ML Document that is edited using Qt C++ Rich Text Widet, and saves it as an H\+T\+ML Document, and when published with send it to the We\+Book\+Server, which can be running on your Local Machine, on a Machine in your Local Network, or a Public V\+PS account, where every We\+Book can be its own Website.

When completed, it will allow multile users, the ability join your Domain, or you can join others, the concept is to Fork this Project, and make your own We\+Book Domains, the concept of Forking, is so you have your Own Git\+Hub Repository, you do not need to alter the Code, its Designed to be Forked, the End Users who Fork it, only need to do pulls to keep it up to date.

This Project uses Zsync2, I am going to write a full Tutorial on how to use it, bascially it allows you to push updates to your Travis and App\+Veyor builds, and anyone that has this App installed, will get a notification of the Update, and it self updates, so no need to make a Linux Repository, since you only need to install the App, I use Qt Installation Framework, so you have a nice Uninstaller also.

I am writting this for Individuals who want to write a book, but want more control over it than Word or Writter can offer, this is not to replace them, in fact it creates documents for them.

Why use We\+Book instead of Word or Writter or other Word Processors?

We\+Book creates Documents for all Word Processors, that is its only job, so the question is, why use We\+Book to make Documents.

The really of Word Processors is called Malware and Viruses, We\+Book only uses Rich Text H\+T\+ML, to eleminate this threat, currently if saves P\+DF and H\+T\+ML, I will expand this to e\+Pub, Docx, R\+TF, Text, and others, and all of them will be less likly to contain malicious code, its really up to the User who inputs the code, and by code, I am talking about the H\+T\+ML code in the Document itself, and there is not much you can do with H\+T\+ML that is malicious, and why its better to use We\+Book than normal Word Processors.

I have a Windows 360 account, and for one reason, I want this app to inferface with it, and that is not a program, in fact, it will make it very easy to manage documents from Onedrive, as it is Google Drive, or others.

Currently I do not have an Import feature, it will be added at some point, first I have to have a Docx Engine, and Doc, Open Office it does by default, my goal is to be able to convert from any format.

This project is gear for Military or Government work, that is where the majority of all the code I have write goes, my goal is to write an Application that can Manage Technical Manuals, that is what a We\+Book is all about.

Security is a major goal, and this Client/\+Server is geared to be a Point-\/to-\/\+Point Security System, but its Security is not part of this Application, making it hard to attack, and no reason to hack it to try to use it to attack, and I got into great deal about how the We\+Book Security System Works, and when completed, I will set up a Hack Server, and invite the World to try to Hack in, and just let it go, with no adnormal admitistration, just normal useage, to prove it can sussain a DoS or Brute Force attacks, without effecting Clients.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Windows}\label{index_autotoc_md19}
Not Working.

Of all days for Qt Download server to go down, I need to compile this on Windows, but cannot download Qt today.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Q\+Text\+Edit}\label{index_autotoc_md20}
The Q\+Text\+Edit widget is an advanced editor that supports formatted rich text. It can be used to display H\+T\+ML and other rich document formats. Internally, Q\+Text\+Edit uses the Q\+Text\+Document class to describe both the high-\/level structure of each document and the low-\/level formatting of paragraphs.

If you are viewing this document in the textedit example, you can edit this document to explore Qt\textquotesingle{}s rich text editing features. We have included some comments in each of the following sections to encourage you to experiment.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysection{Font and Paragraph Styles}\label{index_autotoc_md21}
Q\+Text\+Edit supports {\bfseries{bold}}, {\itshape italic}, \& \sout{strikethrough} font styles, and can display multicolored text. Font families such as Times New Roman and {\ttfamily Courier} can also be used directly. {\itshape If you place the cursor in a region of styled text, the controls in the tool bars will change to reflect the current style.}

Paragraphs can be formatted so that the text is left-\/aligned, right-\/aligned, centered, or fully justified.

{\itshape Try changing the alignment of some text and resize the editor to see how the text layout changes.}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysection{Lists}\label{index_autotoc_md22}
Different kinds of lists can be included in rich text documents. Standard bullet lists can be nested, using different symbols for each level of the list\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Disc symbols are typically used for top-\/level list items.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Circle symbols can be used to distinguish between items in lower-\/level lists.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Square symbols provide a reasonable alternative to discs and circles.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Ordered lists can be created that can be used for tables of contents. Different characters can be used to enumerate items, and we can use both Roman and Arabic numerals in the same list structure\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Introduction
\item Qt Tools 1) Qt Assistant 2) Qt Designer
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Form Editor
\item Component Architecture 3) Qt Linguist
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The list will automatically be renumbered if you add or remove items. {\itshape Try adding new sections to the above list or removing existing item to see the numbers change.}

Task lists can be used to track progress on projects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} This is not yet done
\item This is just a bullet point
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} This is done
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{Images}\label{index_autotoc_md23}
Inline images are treated like ordinary ranges of characters in the text editor, so they flow with the surrounding text. Images can also be selected in the same way as text, making it easy to cut, copy, and paste them.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{logo32.png}%logo
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
   {\itshape Try to select this image by clicking and dragging over it with the mouse, or use the text cursor to select it by holding down Shift and using the arrow keys. You can then cut or copy it, and paste it into different parts of this document.}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Tables}\label{index_autotoc_md24}
Q\+Text\+Edit can arrange and format tables, supporting features such as row and column spans, text formatting within cells, and size constraints for columns.

{\itshape Try adding text to the cells in the table and experiment with the alignment of the paragraphs.}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{Hyperlinks}\label{index_autotoc_md25}
Q\+Text\+Edit is designed to support hyperlinks between documents, and this feature is used extensively in \href{http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtassistant-index.html}{\texttt{ Qt Assistant}}. Hyperlinks are automatically created when an H\+T\+ML file is imported into an editor. Since the rich text framework supports hyperlinks natively, they can also be created programatically.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysection{Undo and Redo}\label{index_autotoc_md26}
Full support for undo and redo operations is built into Q\+Text\+Edit and the underlying rich text framework. Operations on a document can be packaged together to make editing a more comfortable experience for the user.

{\itshape Try making changes to this document and press {\ttfamily Ctrl+Z} to undo them. You can always recover the original contents of the document.}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{Q\+Logger}\label{index_autotoc_md27}
I Forked \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceQLogger}{Q\+Logger}} from \href{https://github.com/francescmm/QLogger}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/francescmm/\+Q\+Logger}}, please see the Wiki \href{https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/WeBookClient/wiki/3.Logging}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Light-\/\+Wizzard/\+We\+Book\+Client/wiki/3.\+Logging}}

I changed this to use q\+Install\+Message\+Handler in main.\+cpp, so it just uses normal q\+Debug.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{End of Read me.}\label{index_autotoc_md28}
