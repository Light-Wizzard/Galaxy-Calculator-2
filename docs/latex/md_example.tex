The Q\+Text\+Edit widget is an advanced editor that supports formatted rich text. It can be used to display H\+T\+ML and other rich document formats. Internally, Q\+Text\+Edit uses the Q\+Text\+Document class to describe both the high-\/level structure of each document and the low-\/level formatting of paragraphs.

If you are viewing this document in the textedit example, you can edit this document to explore Qt\textquotesingle{}s rich text editing features. We have included some comments in each of the following sections to encourage you to experiment.\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Font and Paragraph Styles}\label{md_example_autotoc_md8}
Q\+Text\+Edit supports {\bfseries{bold}}, {\itshape italic}, \& \sout{strikethrough} font styles, and can display multicolored text. Font families such as Times New Roman and {\ttfamily Courier} can also be used directly. {\itshape If you place the cursor in a region of styled text, the controls in the tool bars will change to reflect the current style.}

Paragraphs can be formatted so that the text is left-\/aligned, right-\/aligned, centered, or fully justified.

{\itshape Try changing the alignment of some text and resize the editor to see how the text layout changes.}\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Lists}\label{md_example_autotoc_md9}
Different kinds of lists can be included in rich text documents. Standard bullet lists can be nested, using different symbols for each level of the list\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Disc symbols are typically used for top-\/level list items.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Circle symbols can be used to distinguish between items in lower-\/level lists.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Square symbols provide a reasonable alternative to discs and circles.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Ordered lists can be created that can be used for tables of contents. Different characters can be used to enumerate items, and we can use both Roman and Arabic numerals in the same list structure\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Introduction
\item Qt Tools 1) Qt Assistant 2) Qt Designer
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Form Editor
\item Component Architecture 3) Qt Linguist
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The list will automatically be renumbered if you add or remove items. {\itshape Try adding new sections to the above list or removing existing item to see the numbers change.}

Task lists can be used to track progress on projects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} This is not yet done
\item This is just a bullet point
\item \mbox{[}x\mbox{]} This is done
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Images}\label{md_example_autotoc_md10}
Inline images are treated like ordinary ranges of characters in the text editor, so they flow with the surrounding text. Images can also be selected in the same way as text, making it easy to cut, copy, and paste them.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{logo32.png}%logo
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
   {\itshape Try to select this image by clicking and dragging over it with the mouse, or use the text cursor to select it by holding down Shift and using the arrow keys. You can then cut or copy it, and paste it into different parts of this document.}\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Tables}\label{md_example_autotoc_md11}
Q\+Text\+Edit can arrange and format tables, supporting features such as row and column spans, text formatting within cells, and size constraints for columns.

{\itshape Try adding text to the cells in the table and experiment with the alignment of the paragraphs.}\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Hyperlinks}\label{md_example_autotoc_md12}
Q\+Text\+Edit is designed to support hyperlinks between documents, and this feature is used extensively in \href{http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtassistant-index.html}{\texttt{ Qt Assistant}}. Hyperlinks are automatically created when an H\+T\+ML file is imported into an editor. Since the rich text framework supports hyperlinks natively, they can also be created programatically.\hypertarget{md_example_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Undo and Redo}\label{md_example_autotoc_md13}
Full support for undo and redo operations is built into Q\+Text\+Edit and the underlying rich text framework. Operations on a document can be packaged together to make editing a more comfortable experience for the user.

{\itshape Try making changes to this document and press {\ttfamily Ctrl+Z} to undo them. You can always recover the original contents of the document.}
