# GalaxyCalculator2 About

The Galaxy Calculator is a one button click to calculate, it records the Track Number, 
how many Trinary Engines it takes to be on that track, 
its Suns minimum and maximum Speed in Miles an Hour, the Livable Planets Frequency, 
the Suns Orbital Distance in Miles, and the Tracks Frequency, 
which Sir Isaac Newton used to determine when the End of Civilization will happen, 
and according to his and my calculation, 
that will happen in the year 2060 under the Julian Calendar still used by the Military, 
or 2061 under the Gregorian Calendar in use today, 
this was the same calculation given to the Public, but few know how he calculated it, 
I wrote a new formula, because I could not find his original equation.

Sir Isaac Newton burned his copy of his 2060 Calculation, he wrote that it weights heavy on his SOUL, 
so he had to let it go, 
and wrote that anyone that wants to know, can figure it out, all the formulas are in the Bible, 
36 years later I did find them all.

This Galaxy Calculator was written for use, after I thought about the bash script that created this page:

http://LightWizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/appendix.a.html

The bash script not only crated the page, but calculated the table values.

I hope this helps everyone visualize what the Application needs to do, 
which is only to graph and plot the path of Stars around the Galaxy.

This is not a Galaxy Simulator, only a Graph and Plot, and that is very important to understand, 
I would like to write a Galaxy Simulator built using only the Laws and Rules or Electronics, 
and that project will be called a Galaxy Simulator, and why this Project is only called a Galaxy Calculator,
but I am looking into using Qt 3D Studio to simulate a simulator.
